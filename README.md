# DiceRoller
This is a simple dice rolling app that demonstrates the basic structures for Android apps, including layouts, activities, and inflation. In creating this app, I gained a better understanding of the Gradle file and how dependencies work. I also explored the Manifest file and its importance in composing an Android app.
