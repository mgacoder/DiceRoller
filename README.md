# DiceRoller
This is a simple dice rolling app that demonstrates the basic structures for Android apps, including layouts, activities, and inflation. In creating this app, I gained a better understanding of the Gradle file and how dependencies work. I also explored the Manifest file and its importance in composing an Android app.

## Features
Roll a six-sided die by tapping on a Button View and triggering an onClick event listener

Random number (1 - 6) gets assigned to TextView by finding each view through their unique id with findViewById

View the result of the roll as a number and a drawable vector image of a die face

## Technologies Used
Android Studio

Kotlin
